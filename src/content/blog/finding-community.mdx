Blogging has allowed me an outlet to express my thoughts. Using precise language erases miscommunications. My shy exterior disappears and my confidence shines. Starting a blog is one way that I’ve found community.

Not every new blogger is going to have people who support them. You may have to seek out others. There are ways to do that. I’m going to introduce you to some of my favorites. What I’ve used in the past. It is in this way that I’ve built a professional network that has helped me find work.

## It Is Okay to Promote Your Work

Part of networking is understanding that you need to take pride in your work. At first, approaching people felt like advertising to me. in a sense, it is. My fear was around spamming people.

There is a difference between outreach and spam. Any work you do when talking with others is to make the conversation relevant. We hate getting generic emails sent to anyone. Whose main point is to make a sale. But, a friendly email with an introduction is at the least ignorable. And at the most the start of a new friendship.

Promoting your work is about friendliness. I approach it the same way that I do when meeting new people. Introduce yourself and bring up your work because it is part of who you are. Something that you are proud of. Don’t expect people to respond and don’t hound them to reply. People are busy enough. Keep your expectations realistic.

## My Rules of Engagement

1. Do Some Background Research

The key point here is to make any communication relevant. You do want to do some background research on people. Personal information is not something you should seek. People have public websites and social media. Look at the topics they write about. Make sure you understand their perspectives.

2. Don’t Expect Favors

I don’t think outreach should require a person to take any action. I will sometimes ask someone to share an article if it is relevant to them and their audience. I wouldn’t ask for something like a meeting. That is way too forward and personal. Don’t go in with the expectation that people will do things for you. They may have a lot on their plate. Getting a response always means a lot to me.

3. Only Use Public Information

Some websites will find people’s personal emails at corporations. I would not use a service like that. It scares me enough that these things exist. Only use publicly available information. I only approach people who have their email listed on their websites or use contact forms. This shows they are open to communications. Check if they have any rules about sending emails first.

4. Don’t Use Bulk Email Tools

Don’t use any bulk email programs. If you are going to do any outreach, make it personal and relevant each time. You may not be able to reach as many people as quickly. That is okay. Building relationships is a time investment. Get to know people.

5. Keep It Short

I wouldn’t write much more than a paragraph of text. Get straight to the point and save people time. You do want to make your message warm but you don’t need to do it in a wordy way. Make your communication as clear as possible about why you are reaching out.

## Ways to Find People

The internet is about making connections. There have always been forums for people to meet each other. Here are a few ways that you can find people and perform outreach.

### Forums

There are plenty of forums out there. Don’t ignore places like Reddit or Discord. There is a community for everybody. Most places have their own rules and you need to read this before joining any. But, most within reason, will allow people to share relevant links.

### Social Media

Most social media is searchable in some way. This is necessary to find people to follow. So, search up your relevant keywords and find people who share on those topics. Follow them and respond to what they share.

### Google Search

A Google Search is the best way to find people who are writing in your niche. Unless there is a specific directory that you can use. Look up your keywords and find the blogs that are relevant to your topics. You may not want the ones at the top spots written by corporations. Find the smaller websites by individuals.

Then read those blogs! You can use a tool like Feedly to subscribe to them via RSS feed. Reach out to people after reading their work. Introduce yourself as someone working on the same things. It is nice to make friends with other people who care about the same things as you.

## **The #1 Rule**

Be yourself.

Authenticity is the most important thing. It is okay to get excited about your work and want to share that with others. Especially those who are part of the same communities as you. The truth is, if you know your topic well, you know where people are hanging out. You might even be there already.

A blog is a way to [start a conversation with others](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blogging-key-professional-networking-leads-suzza-silver-djhuf/?trackingId=zbIzLmSmQEqpDzawZIjOYg%3D%3D). Reach out when appropriate and relevant. Share links to your work and ask people to read it. Don’t expect a response and be grateful if you get a reply. Approach outreach in the same way you make friends.

## Conclusion

You can think of a blog as a warm handshake. An open invitation to connect with others. You have to ask yourself, if you are not looking for community then why do you write? Even businesses are looking for customers who share a bond with their products.

How can we help you with your outreach efforts?
