This process will also show you what titles your competitors have written. If they are all using similar titles you want to find another way to say things. For example, for this article, my search revealed that 6 out of the 10 results used “catchy blog title” as a keyword. I wanted to use “blog title” but not use "catchy" at all.

"Blog title" is my topic and tells what my content is about. The other words in my title are whatever I want them to be. It pays to try to write something that looks different from other headlines. You want to avoid the appearance of SEO spam. Think about what infuriates you about Google search. Try to avoid those pitfalls.
